For this exercise you will use functions from the pygame.draw module to
create a figure in a style that was known (by Microsoft) as "Style 1305".
Samples of this style are depicted to the right, but your design must be
unique.
In order to complete this task, you will need to:
• plan out a figure that includes at least one "prop" item
• read about pygame's "polygon" function in the documentation online
Your submission for this exercise:
• must create a window of dimensions at least 300 × 300
• must use the "circle" and "polygon" functions to create a distinct head and body
